                            --- GO FISH ---

The object of the game is to collect the most 4 of a kinds. 
Setup: Shuffle a standard deck of playing cards and deal 5 cards to each player.
Players look at their cards but do not show them to others. 
Pick a player to go first, then play proceeds clockwise.

On your turn you ask 1 other player for any card rank. For example: �Bob, do you have any three�s?� 
The asked player must give you all the cards matching the rank from their hand, then you get to take another turn.
If the asked player doesn�t have any of the asked cards in their hand they say: �Go Fish.� 
You then must draw 1 card from the top of the deck.
If you draw the card you had just asked for, show it and take another turn, otherwise end your turn.

Whenever a player gets all four of cards of the same rank, a �4 of a kind�, 
they immediately remove those cards from their hand and place them grouped together face up in front of themselves.
Whenever a player runs out of cards in their hand they immediately draw 5 new cards from the deck. 
When the deck runs out of cards, play continues until every card in every player�s hand is gone.

The game is now over. Each player receives 1 point for each 4 of a kind match they have in front of them. 
The player with the most points wins.
